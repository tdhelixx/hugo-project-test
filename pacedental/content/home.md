		<h2>
			Frequently Asked Questions
		</h2>
		<p>
			Our team at Pace Dental of Vienna can&rsquo;t wait to help you get the smile that you deserve! You&rsquo;re always welcome to ask any dental questions that might be on your mind; our team will always do their best to provide you with helpful answers. If you would like to try and find the information you need online before reaching out to us, we recommend taking a look at our responses to the frequently asked questions listed below.
		</p>
		<div class="accordion">
			<h3>
				How Can I Make a Same-Day Appointment with a Dentist?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Some dental issues need to be treated as quickly as possible, which is why we offer same-day appointments for patients who need emergency care. If you need to schedule a same-day visit, please give our office a call. You will be able to speak with one of our trustworthy staff members, who will be able to ask questions about your situation and determine how urgent it truly is.
			</p>
			<p>
				Remember, the goal of a same-day appointment is typically to determine the underlying cause of the issue, put a stop to your current discomfort, and figure out what treatments will be needed moving forward.
			</p>
			<h3>
				How Do I Find the Best Place to Get Dental Work Done?
			</h3>
			<p>
				There are many dental practices to choose from. To narrow down the one that&rsquo;s right for you, think about what you&rsquo;re looking for. Do you need a practice that will take your specific insurance plan? Do you want an office that&rsquo;s close to your home? Is there a specific service that you would want your new dentist to be able to provide?
			</p>
			<p>
				Once you&rsquo;ve come up with some criteria, you can look for a practice that fits what you&rsquo;re looking for. You can also learn more about the dentist&rsquo;s credentials by reading their online biography, and you can check their reviews to see what their patients think of their services.
			</p>
			<h3>
				How Much Does a Dental Check-Up and Cleaning Cost in Vienna, VA?
			</h3>
			<p>
				In the United States, many people end up paying between $200 and $350 for routine dental checkups and cleanings. However, there are several factors that can influence the cost, like the geography of the practice. Also, many dental insurance companies will help pay for checkups and cleanings, with the exact level of coverage offered depending on which plan you have.
			</p>
			<h3>
				What Do You Do If You Can&rsquo;t Afford a Dentist?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Some people avoid having dental work performed because they&rsquo;re worried about the cost. However, it&rsquo;s better for your mouth and your wallet to avoid oral health issues altogether when possible, which is why it&rsquo;s worth fitting dental care into your budget. If you&rsquo;re worried about paying for dentistry, you can:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Take advantage of your dental insurance benefits.
				</li>
				<li>
					Sign up for Pace Dental Smile Club to receive discounts on many of our services.
				</li>
				<li>
					Apply for third-party financing through CareCredit, allowing you to pay for your care in smaller, easier-to-manage installments.
				</li>
			</ul>
